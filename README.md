# My Shop Orders
My shop orders is a private store management app that fetches shop orders from the store google spreadsheet database. This app can write to the google spreadsheet and also read from it.
It uses OkHTTP3 to handle transfer between the google spreadsheet and the shop order database server. 
This app also uses the Google appscript code in other to make sure that the app connects with the database. The app script makes it easier to establish a connection using OkHTTP3 and the spreadsheet server.
